## Qt6 Docker Builder for Raspberry Pi

This Docker image builds and cross compiles Qt 6.5.3 for Raspberry Pi. 
It generates build for host and RPi so it can be used with Qt Creator after build. 
It generates a 2024-07-04-raspios-bookworm-arm64-lite.img, ready to install to SD card, containing all necessary packages and libraries to run Qt on Raspberry Pi. 

## Building the Docker image and running the container

- Install `qemu-user-static` on host machine.

```
sudo apt install qemu-user-static
```

- Clone this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/giobauermeister/qt-rpi-docker-builder.git
```

- cd to cloned repo and build docker image

```
cd qt-rpi-docker-builder

docker build --build-arg USER=$(id -nu) --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) --tag qt-builder/qt-builder:1.0 .
```

- Create the folder $HOME/qt-build on host machine to access build artifacts generated by container.

```
mkdir $HOME/qt-build
```

- Run a container with the image and pass $HOME/qt-build as volume

```
docker run --privileged -it -v $HOME/qt-build:$HOME/qt-build qt-builder/qt-builder:1.0
```

- You should have the following build artifacts generated

```
ls -l $HOME/qt-build

qt6
qt-raspi
qt-host
